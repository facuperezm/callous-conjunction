- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Optimizations

The project includes various optimizations such as refactors for cleaner code, performance improvements for faster load times, and enhanced accessibility features.

## Challenges

Learning to use the OpenAI API with different large language models (LLMs) has been a significant challenge and a great learning experience. Managing the temperature settings and selecting the appropriate model for different purposes has been intricate. Additionally, understanding the importance of tokens and their management has been crucial in optimizing the performance and cost-efficiency of the translations.
